    <h1>Instructions to get up and running for helping me test Stations</h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download the
        <a href="https://metamask.io/download/">official Metamask extension</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the Metamask instructions. Make sure you write down and save
        your seed phrase.
      </li>
      <li>
        We'll be using the Harmony network for our test stations.
        Navigate to <a href="https://stations.network/add-network">https://stations.network/add-network</a>
        and click on the Harmony button. It should automatically configure
        metamask to use the right network for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you open Metamask, near the top there should be something that
        says "Account 1" and, under that, an abbreviated hexidecimal address.
        This is your Ethereum address. Clicking on that element of the
        extension will copy your address to the system clipboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Send me a text with your address and I'll send you some ONE (the
        currency used to pay for the (nearly free) transaction fees on
        Harmony.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitor your account balance and, when the ONE comes in, confirm
        receipt.
      </li>
      <li>
        I haven't added a friendly UI to join a station so send me your
        desired screenname (this can always be changed) and I'll add you
        to "The Lotus Eaters".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br/><br/>
    <h1>Using "The Lotus Eaters" station</h1>
    <i><small>
       The instructions for usage are invariant of which particular station
       you're on but, since "The Lotus Eaters" will be our first/primary
       multi-user test stations, let's make it concrete, shall we?
    </small></i>

    Blah blah
